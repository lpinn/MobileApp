        Building New Hope is a volunteer-driven nonprofit organization based in
        Pittsburgh and Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, we partner with a worker-owned
        organic coffee cooperative, operate two supplemental schools for at-risk
        youth, and provide high school scholarships for students in need. In
        Pittsburgh, we engage with local schools and universities, faith groups,
        farmers, non-profits, community groups, and businesses to promote
        healthy ecosystems and to spread awareness about how fair trade
        relationships can help to reduce poverty and inequalities. Our reach may
        be broad but our mission is simple: help those in need by providing
        educational opportunities and fair prices for goods and services
